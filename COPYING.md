These bitmaps come from the oldest version of Xboard I could find,
xboard-3.6.2, from 1997.

In xboard 3.6.2, there is this notice in the directory with the
bitmaps:

“The 80x80 bitmaps in this directory are taken from the XChess program,
which was written and is copyrighted by Wayne Christopher.”

Looking around, I found this copyright for the older (and no longer
available) XChess program:
